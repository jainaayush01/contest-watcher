### Demo

### Run the backend
```
cd backend
npm install
npm run start
```
Note: you don;t need to run the backend server it is already up and running on my [repl](https://replit.com/@jainaayush01/clist-contests#index.js), just fetch the data from it

### Add extension to chrome
* Open extensions tab in Chrome, turn developer mode on
* Select `LOAD UNPACKED`, then select the extension folder in dialog box
* Good to go

### What did i learnt?
I learnt about chrome notifications, alarms, manifiest.json, Chrome Security Policy, resolving cors errors(yeah always a tough one) 

### Why backend server was needed?
* The backend server was needed because of the CORS, you need to make a fetch request from a server to fetch data from clist.by website, you can't make a request from frontend directly it sends you an error so i need to create a server and it is running on a [repl](https://replit.com/@jainaayush01/clist-contests#index.js).
